# Flotiq Typescript Fetch API Integration

This package is auto-generated by the `flotiq-codegen-ts` command.

## Overview

This package provides a **Typescript Fetch API** integration for your Flotiq project. It includes all necessary TypeScript definitions and functions to seamlessly interact with the Flotiq API.

## Important Notice

Do not manually edit the contents of this directory.
Any changes will be overwritten the next time you run the `flotiq-codegen-ts` command.

## Package versions

You can install this package in two versions, depending on your project's needs:

1. **TypeScript Version**
TypeScript projects that only require TypeScript code:
```bash
npx flotiq-codegen-ts
```

2. **JavaScript Version (CommonJS vs. ESM)**
If your project requires compiled JavaScript code, run the following command to generate it:
```bash
npx flotiq-codegen-ts --compiled-js
```
This will generate the JavaScript code that can be used in either CommonJS or ESM environments.
